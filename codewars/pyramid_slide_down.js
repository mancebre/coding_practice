 Lyrics...
Pyramids are amazing! Both in architectural and mathematical sense. If you have a computer, 
you can mess with pyramids even if you are not in Egypt at the time. For example, 
let's consider the following problem. Imagine that you have a pyramid built of numbers, 
like this one here:

   /3/
  \7\ 4 
 2 \4\ 6 
8 5 \9\ 3
Here comes the task...
Let's say that the 'slide down' is a sum of consecutive numbers from the top to the bottom of 
the pyramid. As you can see, the longest 'slide down' is 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23

Your task is to write a function longestSlideDown (in ruby: longest_slide_down) that takes a 
pyramid representation as argument and returns its' longest 'slide down'. For example,

longestSlideDown([[3], [7, 4], [2, 4, 6], [8, 5, 9, 3]]) => 23
By the way...
My tests include some extraordinarily high pyramides so as you can guess, brute-force method 
is a bad idea unless you have a few centuries to waste. You must come up with something more 
clever than that.

(c) This task is a lyrical version of the Problem 18 and/or Problem 67 on ProjectEuler.

function longestSlideDown (pyramid) {
    let x = 0
    let result = 0;
    for(let i = 0; i < pyramid.length; i++) {
        console.log(pyramid[i][x]);
        result += pyramid[i][x];
        x++;
    }

    return result;
}
